# Eventbrite API - Title Link to Eventbrite

Rather than linking to the single page view of the event, title links point straight to the event's page on [eventbrite.com](https://eventbrite.com).

#### Requirements

This plugin requires the [Eventbrite API plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/eventbrite-api/) working with a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) install.
